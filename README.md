This repository contains a Python script for implementing a simple trading strategy based on the Golden Cross and Death Cross signals. 

## Strategy Overview

The primary strategy is based on the Golden Cross and Death Cross indicators. A Golden Cross occurs when the short-term moving average (50-day) crosses above the long-term moving average (200-day), which is considered a bullish signal. Conversely, a Death Cross occurs when the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average, considered a bearish signal.
